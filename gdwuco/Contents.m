%   Abstract
%   --------
%
%   Redundant Gabor frames admit an infinite number of dual frames, yet
%   only the canonical dual Gabor system, constructed from the minimal
%   $l_2$-norm dual window, is widely used. This window function
%   however, might lack desirable properties, such as good time-frequency
%   concentration, small support or smoothness. We employ convex
%   optimization methods to design dual windows satisfying the Wexler-Raz
%   equations and optimizing various constraints. Numerical experiments
%   suggest that alternate dual windows with considerably improved features
%   can be found.
